### TODO:
1. ###### jupyter notebook
    1. Read the first paragraph (JupyterLab 1.0...) in [this site](https://jupyter.org/index.html) and try jupyterlab. 
    2. Using docker, create your own jupyter instance:
        1. ###### Configuration File
            1. Find the configuration file jupyter uses
            2. Read about the following settings: `c.NotebookApp.kernel_manager_class`, `c.NotebookApp.webapp_settings`
        2. ###### Kernel Logs
            1. Create a new notebook and execute a simple python cell
            2. Incpect the Kernel log file and look for the following:
                - The kernel startup process
                - The code execution process
                - The output rendering process
        3. ###### Network Traffic
            1. Capture the traffic between the Jupyer client and the server
            2. Inspect the captured traffic and look for the following:
                - WebSocket connection establishment
                - The code execution requests and responses
                - The output rendering requests and response


2. ###### jupyterlab  
    1. Read what jupyterlab is, what are it's benefits.
    2. Add jupyterlab and any jupyterlab extension you'd like to your image from before, make sure you can explain why you think this extension is useful.
