##### ETC: 1 day

Shall you aim for the moon but you were too drank, jupyter has enough (also enough resources, and you know, that sweet ml blockchain GPUs..)<br>

### TODO:
1. ###### jupyterlab
    1. Read the first paragraph (JupyterLab 1.0...) in [this site](https://jupyter.org/index.html) and try jupyterlab.

    2. Look at how they built it! there's nothing more fun than other people's source code. [just look!](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/base-notebook) and try to understand what they're doing in the Dockerfile and the start-singleuser script.
    3. You saw which docker image they used? in the army we like centos7, try to build it with centos7 a base image (change the dockerfile a bit to make it work)
    4. Run it. works? Good. You may go to the jupyterhub section. If not, we believe in you, try again.  

2.  ###### jupyterhub      
    1. Read [this](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/technical-overview.html) and click on the bottom links for Spawners and Authenticators (read them too ;) )
    2. Run jupyterhub on your pc with dockerspawner. Use the files provided. 
    3. Test your image in your hub. Try as user guest and as admin, checkout the diffrences.

3.  ###### jupyterlab
    1. Read what jupyterlab is, what are it's benefits.
    2. Add jupyterlab and any jupyterlab extension you'd like to your image from before, make sure you can explain why you think this extension is useful.
