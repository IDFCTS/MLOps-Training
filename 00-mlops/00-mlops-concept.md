During this section you are meant to understand the concept of MLops, what it is, and what we aim to do as a team.
##### ETC: 2 days

### TODO:
1. [Google what's MLops](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=mlops)
2. Read this glossary about [MLops](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/mlops)
3. Search what tools we have in the TS, don't need to know how they work, just what they do in a general sense, you'll get a deep dive into them in the future.
### Key Concepts:
- Main workflow of ML
- What we have currently provided in the cloud
- What's the ideal workflow for a data scientist to work, what role do we fill in their workflow as a team.

### Final Exercise:
Choose a subject within the MLops world, and give us a lecture about it, the lecture should be about 10-15 minutes long, and hopefully contain good memes.
