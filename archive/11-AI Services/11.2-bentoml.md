# Bentoml

### TODO:

- [Bentoml vs Other backend Frameworks](https://bentoml.com/blog/breaking-up-with-flask-amp-fastapi-why-ml-model-serving-requires-a-specialized-framework)
- [Bentoml quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/v1.1.11/quickstarts/deploy-an-iris-classification-model-with-bentoml.html)

*Note that we use bentoml 1.1 so consider this when looking at the correct docomuntion pages*

### Key Concepts:
- Service
- Inputs and Outputs
- Runners
- Bento Files
- Adaptive Batching

### Final Exercise:
- Compare bentoml to other model deployment frameworks
- Deploy the model you used in the AI services chapter with bentoml and deploy it on openshift.
- Monitor your application via Splunk by creating the appropriate dashboard.
