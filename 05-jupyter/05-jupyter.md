    2. Look at how they built it! there's nothing more fun than other people's source code. [just look!](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/main/images/base-notebook) and try to understand what they're doing in the Dockerfile and the start-singleuser script.
    3. You saw which docker image they used? in the army we like centos7, try to build it with centos7 a base image (change the dockerfile a bit to make it work)
    4. Run it. works? Good.


2. ###### jupyterlab  
    1. Read what jupyterlab is, what are it's benefits.
    2. Add jupyterlab and any jupyterlab extension you'd like to your image from before, make sure you can explain why you think this extension is useful.
    3. Configure timeout that turns off the notebook after 5 minutes of it being idle
