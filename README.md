## Rolling Exercise:
Those are the Coronavirus days, the markets are failing, and the most important question is
`WIll a simple solider, a pawn, be able to afford to buy the food of the gods, AVOCADO?`
During your training process, you will create a full-stack app that will solve this question.
Your app is a website that will predict the price of an avocado, given proper input, of course.
You can find a template for the website, so you will know what is going to be the input needed for a prediction,
then the input will be sent to the backend using an API you will create, and in the backend
your ML model will predict the avocado price, and return it to the website.
