# MLflow

By the end of this section, you will learn how to our model tracking tool of choice, MLflow.

##### ETC: 5 days

### TODO:

1. The the introduction to [MLflow](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2018/06/05/introducing-mlflow-an-open-source-machine-learning-platform.html)
2. Deploy an MLflow server locally.

### Key Concepts:

- tracking
- model registry
- projects
- models

### Final Exercise:

- Find some ML Code that doesn't log with mlflow on the web/in the environment (don't worry, there are plenty of examples). Use mlflow to log its parameters, artifacts and the end model.
- Read about Nginx and then sit with one of the team members abotu the architecture.
