# Machine Learning
##### ETC: 12 days
I hope you like buzzwords because this is the hottest field in the hi-tech industry these days.
This section is a small introduction to an unbelievably huge field, so it is extremely recommended to
read more about this subject.

### Final Exercise:
Create a model that predicts avocado prices. You can find the dataset in this folder.
Use the jupyterhub in the TS to write your code, and use the DGX to run jobs to train the model.
Try use everything you have learned to make the most accurate model you can!
Then, pack your model as a python package, and add it to your app. Now, for the first time, 
your app is fully functioning!
