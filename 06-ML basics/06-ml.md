# Machine Learning
I hope you like buzzwords because this is the hottest field in the hi-tech industry these days.
This section is a small introduction to an unbelievably huge field, so it is extremely recommended to
read more about this subject. 


### TODO:

### Final Exercise:
Create a model that predicts avocado prices. You can find the dataset in this folder.
Try use everything you have learned to make the most accurate model you can!
